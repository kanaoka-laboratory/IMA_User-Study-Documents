# Image Movement Attacks Research Repository

## Overview
This repository is part of our research project on **Image Movement Attacks (IMA)** in Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) systems.  
As one of the outcomes of this project, we presented a paper at **IEEE MetaCom 2025**:

- *Image Movement Attacks on Optical See-Through HMDs: Covert Gaze Manipulation and Privacy Risks in AR/MR Systems*  
  Authors: Shodai Kurasaki, Akira Kanaoka  

The purpose of this repository is to enhance **transparency** and **reproducibility** of our research by making available the experimental materials used in our user study.

## Released Materials
This repository currently contains the following English-translated documents:
- **Semi-structured interview script** used during the experiment:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Post-task questionnaire** administered after the experiment:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

These materials were originally written in Japanese and later translated into English.

## Usage
The provided materials can be used for:
- Reference in designing user studies on AR/MR security
- Comparative analysis with other perceptual manipulation attack studies
- Supporting replication or extension of our experiments
